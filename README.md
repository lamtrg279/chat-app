# Real-time chat application
In this project, I built a full stack web application using Socket.io and React.js to implement a basic real-time chat application that supports 2 or more users with CSS files provided by online tutorial. 

## Implementation Details
- Required node.js
- Commands (need 2 terminals): 
    - cd client -> npm start (make the server to listen to port 3001)
    - cd server -> npm start (run the react front end side at port 3000)
